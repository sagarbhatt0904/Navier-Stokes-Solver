This is a general incompressible navier stokes solver. With different initial and boundary conditions, most problems with incompressible flow can be solved.
Provide "init.h" and "BC.h" files that suit your needs and run the "run.sh" file. Three files will be generated :

xvel.vtk : X-velocity
yvel.vtk : Y-velocity
Press.vtk : Pressure
